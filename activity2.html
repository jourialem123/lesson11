        <p>The cat (Felis catus), also referred to as domestic cat or house cat, is a small domesticated carnivorous mammal. It is
        the only domesticated species of the family Felidae. Advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the
        domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a house pet and farm cat, but
        also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact. Valued by humans for companionship and its ability to kill
        vermin, the cat's retractable claws are adapted to killing small prey like mice and rats. It has a strong, flexible
        body, quick reflexes, and sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. It is a social
        species, but a solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator. Cat communication includes vocalizations—including meowing,
        purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting–as well as body language. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in
        frequency for human ears, such as those made by small mammals. It secretes and perceives pheromones.
        
        Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn in temperate zones and throughout the year in
        equatorial regions, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens. Domestic cats are bred and shown at events
        as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy. Animal population control of cats may be achieved by spaying
        and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats
        worldwide, contributing to the extinction of bird, mammal, and reptile species.
